# NetTrafficAnalyzer
The Network Sniffer is a Python-based tool designed to capture and analyze network packets in real-time. Utilizing the powerful Scapy library, this project enables users to monitor network traffic, inspect packet details, and gain insights into the data flowing through their network.

*Key Features:*

Real-Time Packet Capture: Capture packets from the network interface in real-time, allowing for immediate analysis of network activity.

Packet Inspection: View detailed summaries of captured packets, including source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and reports of any suspcious packages.

Customizable Filters: Implement filters to capture specific types of packets based on criteria such as protocol, source/destination IP, and port numbers.

User -Friendly Interface: Simple command-line interface for easy interaction and execution of packet sniffing tasks.

Educational Tool: Ideal for learning about network protocols, packet structures, and network security concepts.

*Use Cases:*

Network troubleshooting and diagnostics

Security analysis and intrusion detection

Educational purposes for students and professionals learning about networking

Monitoring network performance and traffic patterns

*Requirements:*

Python 3.10,11 or 13

Scapy library

Npcap (for Windows users) or libpcap (for Linux users)

Installation: To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to capture network traffic on your system.

The Network Sniffer is an efficient and multi-purpose tool coded in Python that can capture and inspect network packets in real time. Based on the strength of the Scapy library, the project gives users the power to listen to network traffic, examine packet information, and harvest great intelligence on the data running through their networks. Regardless of whether for learning, network debugging, or security auditing, the Network Sniffer is an indispensable tool for anyone wishing to learn about network communications.One of the most impressive capabilities of the Network Sniffer is real-time packet capture. Users are able to view network traffic as it occurs, enabling them to analyze data flows in real-time. This is a valuable asset for network administrators and security analysts who must identify problems or potential vulnerabilities in real-time.

*Use Cases*
The Network Sniffer can be used in several situations. For network administrators, it is a godsend for troubleshooting and 
network diagnostics. Administrators can determine bottlenecks, unauthorized access, and other irregularities that can impact 
network performance by intercepting and inspecting packets.


Security professionals can use the Network Sniffer to perform comprehensive security analysis. Through network traffic 
monitoring, they are able to identify possible intrusions, study patterns of attack, and respond to security events more 
efficiently. The utility also supports security policy compliance through giving visibility into network activity.

For learning about networking by students and professionals alike, the Network Sniffer is a great teaching tool. It can be 
used to try out packet capture and analysis, thereby understanding how the network works and how all the protocols in the 
data transmission process work.
In short, Network Sniffer is a powerful and versatile utility that gives users the ability to capture and inspect network packets with ease. With its real-time monitoring feature, in-depth packet analysis, and adjustable filtering capabilities, it is a must-have for network administrators, security experts, and anyone curious about peeking behind the scenes of network communications. By allowing users an accessible interface and acting as an instructional platform, the Network Sniffer also facilitates a better understanding of networking concepts and practices. For troubleshooting, security analysis, or education, this project is a worthy addition to the arsenal of network enthusiasts.
